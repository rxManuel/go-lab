## About
This repo will contain my learning process in goLang 
### Courses
#### goSpecialization
    This folder contains all exercises for the MOOC: Programming with Google Go
    There is no _mod_ files since each file could be run independently
    Use `go run file.go` e.g. `go run animals.go` under goSpecialization\course1 folder
    
### Exercises
#### paradigms-for-interviews
    This folder contains different ways to solve common problems like _primenumber_ so each exercise has its own _mod_ file
    So you can test each solution by using `go test` under each package like imperative/dynamic or declarative/classical or also `go test ./..` under exercise folder like primenumer/
