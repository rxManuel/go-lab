# GO-LAB
## About
This repo contains my learning process with the Go programming language.
### Courses
#### goSpecialization 
This folder contains all the exercises from the MOOC: _Programming with Google Go_. **There are no module files, since each file can be run independently.**
* [`Fundamentals`](goSpecialization/course1)
* [`Functions and Interfaces`](goSpecialization/course2)
* [`Concurrency`](goSpecialization/course3)
    
### Exercises
#### paradigms-for-interviews´
This folder contains different ways to solve common problems, such as prime numbers, so each exercise has its own module file. You can test each solution by running `go test` inside each package—like `imperative/dynamic` or `declarative/classical`—or by running `go test ./...` inside the exercise folder, such as `primenumber/`.
* [`is it a Prime Number?`](paradigms-for-interviews/primenumber)
